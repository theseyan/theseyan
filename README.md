âœ¨ I`m a Full Stack Web Developer who prefers vanilla JavaScript over heavy frameworks. I have a long history in DevOps, cooking up highly available & scalable backend systems, and devising efficient database schemas.

I contribute to the Open Source community whenever I can amidst working on some of my own projects.
When I'm not behind the computer screen, you can find me riding a bicycle and playing football.
